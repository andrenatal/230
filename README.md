## Description

It was proposed to develop a computer vision system able to analyze tennis matches in real time and classify strokes and similarities with reference players by using models trained on pose estimation from videos of professional players.

The ultimate motivation is to have an extensible AI platform that could help build performance improvements, technique enhancement, and injury prevention that can be used as an additional tool to coaching.

Given the low dimensionality and high-level representation of poses and body joints, the same mechanics and systems can also be extended to other sports where biomechanics and body movement are key to achieving high performance. 

Recreational players can also benefit from it. By having their footage analyzed by the system, they can potentially learn their handicaps but also prevent injuries that arise from bad swings.
